\usage{
combine_circrna_methods(
  file_names,
  filter = TRUE,
  min_reads = 2,
  min_methods = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_names}{a names list of the file names to be combined}

\item{filter}{if TRUE performs a filtering on the circRNAs included in the
results: only circRNAs with >= _min\_reads_ and detected by >= _min\_methods_
will be included}

\item{min_reads}{the minimum read count a circRNA must have to be included in
the results when the _filter_ option is enabled}

\item{min_methods}{the minimum number of methods a circRNA must be detected
by to be included in the results when the _filter_ option is enabled}
}
